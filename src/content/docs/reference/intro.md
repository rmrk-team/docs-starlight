The Reference is here to tell you about the contracts and interfaces of modular
NFTs. The Reference is highly technical and terse, designed to give you only the
technical details about a tool, library, contract, or implementation, and is
meant to be followed along with your exploration of production code, or while
reading [How-To Guides](/guides/intro), if you find yourself wanting to
understand the ins and outs of what you're working on.
