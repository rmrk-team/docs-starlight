Guides lead a user through a specific task they want to accomplish.

This section assumes that you already have some basic knowledge and are trying
to finish a specific task. We have done our best to document as many of these
common scenarios as we could think of, but if you find some missing, please get
in touch via [Telegram](https://t.me/rmrkimpl).
