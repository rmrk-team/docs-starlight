title: RMRK Minis
description: A collection of mini-apps to test the modular NFT functionality
---

To better communicate the value proposition of modular NFTs and to make them
easier to understand and use, the RMRK team has developed the following
mini-apps (minis).

## Mintaur

[Mintaur.app](https://minatur.app) allows anyone to set up a lazy-minting
process for a new NFT collection. It supports making these NFTs equippable,
soulbound, or any combination of the RMRK NFT legos. The Mintaur app also allows
you to follow creators, to be notified when they launch a new collection, and to
inspect people's profiles to see what they collected or launched.

## Emotes

[Emotes.app](https://emotes.app) allows you to place
[emotes](/explanations/nft_legos/emote) (reactions) onto any NFT - it supports
both legacy NFTs and modular NFTs. This is then easy to read into various
applications, allowing for custom mechanics based on people's reactions to an
NFT, like watering a plant with üí¶ to not make it die, or giving a tamagotchi üçñ
so it doesn't starve, or even using simple like / dislike mechanics for social
scoring of social media posts.

## Upgradooor

[Upgradooor.app](https://upgradooor.app) allows you to upgrade any legacy NFT
(ERC 721) into more advanced modular NFT standards. This lets owners of legacy
NFTs enjoy [equippability](/explanations/nft_legos/equippable),
[evolution](/explanations/ose), and more.

## Wizard

[Wizard.rmrk.dev](https://wizard.rmrk.dev) is a no-code-for-code UI for building
custom contracts based on RMRK modular NFT legos. The easiest way to get started
building a comprehensive advanced NFT collection without having to write all the
code from scratch.
