RMRK is a set of smart contract standards for EVM-based blockchains like
Ethereum, Moonbeam, Polygon, Zora, and similar.

These smart contract standards structures for advanced applications like
ticketing, multi-multimedia books, are designed to work together, much like Lego
blocks, and to use NFTs as data game items and avatars, multi-user musical
compositions, and more.

Some of the possible use cases will be explained in this section of the docs.

## What is RMRK's history?

RMRK (pronounced "remark") was founded as a hobby project in 2020 by [Bruno
Å kvorc](https://twitter.com/bitfalls), Web3 Foundation's technical educator at
the time. Learn more about some of the current team on [the
homepage](https://rmrk.app).

The RMRK team is the custodian and main developer of the set of open source
modular NFT standards known as _RMRK standards_, and a for-profit company
building products on top of this infrastructure, such as the [Singular
marketplace](https://singular.app).

Put bluntly, the RMRK team wanted to build cool products, but the infrastructure
to build them on did not exist yet so they chose to build the infrastructure
first. This infrastructure is now available to everyone in the form of open
source EVM smart contract standards and accompanying tools.

## The RMRK Token

The [RMRK token](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/rmrk/) is the protocol's
official token.

It is not required to use the protocol, but can augment the experience, and is
required as a deposit for Sybil resistance and spam resistance when creating
collections that get auto-added to Singular from the various supported chains.
For more information about the $RMRK token, please see [the tokens
page](https://www.rmrk.app/blog/rmrk-tokens).
