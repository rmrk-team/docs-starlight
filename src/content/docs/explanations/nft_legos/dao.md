title: NFTs as DAOs
description: The ability to govern NFT actions as a collective
---

Being able to turn an NFT into a DAO refers to the ability of RMRK NFTs to be
fractionalized for a deposit in [RMRK
tokens](https://www.rmrk.app/blog/rmrk-tokens).

These share tokens can then be used to collectively issue commands to an NFT.
This video demonstrates one of the potential use cases:

Another possible use case is a collective gaming experience where a Twitch
streamer tokenizes an in-game avatar and distributes the tokens live to their
community to participate in in-game decision making during the game.

Alternatively, it can also be used for partial ownership of high-value NFTs.

This feature has not yet been added to any implementation, but there is a bounty
available for this. [Get in touch](https://t.me/rmrk_impl) to learn more.
