[Singular](https://singular.app) is RMRK's flagship product, the multi-chain modular NFT marketplace
designed to showcase full modular NFT functionality.

Singular supports several EVM chains, and more are on the way. For a full list,
see the homepage at [Singular.app].

## Minting

On Singular, anyone can launch a new collection or individual NFT and put it up
for sale. The UI is designed to be intuitive, and the various popover guides
will help clarify whatever might be unclear.

## Trading

Trading is done via:

- Buy It Now, where the seller sets the fixed price and waits for a buyer
- Offers, where potential buyers can make offers on unlisted NFTs
- English Auctions, where a bid starts low and the highest bidder wins
- GBM auctions, also known as bid-to-earn, a unique way of trading where one is
  paid for losing an auction and can therefore only win the asset or win free
  money

## Profiles and personalization

Singular integrates with ENS for profile customization and .eth name support.
Any values you set on ENS will be visible on Singular, including but not limited
to avatar, background, social media handles and contact info, and more.
