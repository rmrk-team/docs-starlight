Using [equipping logic](/explanations/nft_legos/equippable) and [multi asset
NFTs](/explanations/nft_legos/equippable), one could create a puzzle NFT with
specific slots for puzzle-pieces.

Collectors would then need to collect these pieces - either through some
contests, random draws, treasure hunts, or even purely secondary purchases - and
equip the parts into their puzzle.

Similar projects already exist:

- [Proof of Chaos](https://proofofchaos.app/)
- [Ukraine Relief Stamp Album](https://twitter.com/StampForUkraine)

An advanced version of this approach is a remake of the popular "one million
dollar" website, or BAYC graffiti wall - one could make a single puzzle NFT into
which others could _guest-equip_ (a new RMRK functionality for temporary
nesting) their pieces. 

This would allow for an interesting contest and collaborative experience in
composing a single multi-user graphic wall, or could even expand to other media,
like [collaborative music compositions](/explanations/usecases/collabmusic).

The original issuer of the parent NFT could then choose to "seal" the state of
the wall at a certain point in time, disallowing withdrawals of the guest NFTs
and finalizing the pieces into a piece of collaborative art of which one can
mint a limited number of copies, perhaps limited in amount to the number of
unique contributors to this art.
