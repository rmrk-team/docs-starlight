Because all RMRK [nestable](/explanations/nft_legos/nestable) and
[equippable](/explanations/nft_legos/equippable) NFTs are mutually compatible and can
leverage [multi assets](/explanations/nft_legos/multiasset) to use different media and art
styles for this cross-collection compatibility, the concept of a _Global Item
Economy_ appears.

This also creates another concept: dynamic rarity (DR).

Traditionally in other ecosystems, if you have a collection of 10000 Sparrows
and 5 of them have a gold chain, then the rarity of the gold-chained Sparrow is
5/10000.

With RMRK's modular NFT standards, not only is this gold chain equippable onto
all other Sparrows, but someone else can later launch a totally unrelated
collection of Robots who are made compatible with this gold chain.

The gold chain NFTs would be given a [new asset](/explanations/nft_legos/multiasset) which
visually matches the style of the robot project, and would become equippable by
the 10000 Robots.

Now, the rarity of the gold chain is no longer 5 / 10000, but 5 / 20000.

Therefore, the demand for this NFT went up, because it is now usable in twice as
many other NFTs. Its dynamic rarity score has increased.

This does not have to stop at visual accessories. As noted in
[equippables](/explanations/nft_legos/equippable):

The DR score of the music tracks goes up by a lot, purely because they have been
made compatible with tens of thousands of virtual real estate plots.
